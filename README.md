# ABOUT PROJECT 
Pathway enables seamless aggregation and analysis of real-time data streams from multiple sources. In this project:

Health Metrics, such as heart rate, steps, and SpOâ‚‚, are simulated and updated every 3 seconds using JavaScript.

These metrics are dynamically displayed on the dashboard, providing a foundation for personalized health recommendations.

This setup simulates real-time health data and establishes a system for periodic data collection and analysis.


RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines enhance the system by incorporating external knowledge into real-time data processing. In this project:

Weather and Air Quality Data are fetched from external APIs (OpenWeather API) to generate context-aware recommendations.

The pipeline combines external context (e.g., temperature, weather, air quality) with real-time health metrics. This layered approach ensures more precise and actionable recommendations.

Recommendations are generated using a simple rule-based approach, combining real-time health data with external environmental factors.
